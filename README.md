PL101 - Grammers, Parses and Languages
=========
This is my code for the the languages class at http://nathansuniversity.com/

MUS (https://github.com/jamsajones/language-class-nu/mus)
----------
We have a language that takes a series of notes and puts them into the a "playable"

Scheme (https://github.com/jamsajones/language-class-nu/scheme)
----------
My simple implementation of a scheme language.

You can do cool things like
```(+ 1 (+ 2 3))```
or
```(read (
	'file.png
))```

Right now it simply turns the language into a series of arrays.
