PL101 - Grammers, Parses and Languages
=========
This is my code for the the languages class at http://nathansuniversity.com/

MUS Code
----------
We have a language that takes a series of notes and puts them into the a "playable"

Scheem Code
----------
My simple implementation of a scheme like language.

You can do cool things like

```(+ 1 (+ 2 3))```

or

```(read 'file.png)```

Right now it simply turns the language into a series of arrays.
